This repository contains my assignments for the CDP Mapping Systems course. Due to a critical bug in GitHub Desktop that required troubleshooting, I had to delete all previous repositories.

Assignments 01-03 have been reuploaded here with identical content to the original submissions.

Assignment 04 was entirely created after the repository deletion and represents new work.

Note on Assignment 01: The historical building dataset was not fully visualized — due to its overwhelming size, my laptop could not handle the complete processing. Instead, I extracted a radom subset for visualization, so the results may appear partial.

For Assignment 03, the extended research and implementation (requiring a standalone website) — which has been shown in the presentation — are available in a dedicated repository:
